Welcome! I am a Ph.D Candidate at finance department, Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. My primary research interest is `corporate finance theory`, focusing on financing of innovations. My job market paper exhibits how private startups make acquisitions to signal their quality for IPO.  Besides, I am working on empirical projects in the `healthcare industry`.

I joined the Finance Ph.D. program at University of Minnesota in September 2014. I also hold a B.S. in Economics from Peking University, China.
