    abstract: How do innovative firms react when existing products experience negative shocks? We explore this question with detailed project-level data from drug development firms. Using FDA Public Health Advisories as idiosyncratic negative shocks to approved drugs, we examine how drug makers react through investment decisions. Following these shocks, affected firms increase R&D expenditures, driven by a higher likelihood of acquiring external innovations, rather than developing novel projects internally. Such acquisition activities are concentrated in firms with weak research pipelines. We also find that competing developers move resources away from the affected therapeutic areas. Our results show how investments in specialized commercialization capital create path dependencies and alter the direction of R&D investments.

    abstract: How does common ownership affect innovation? We study this question using project-level data on pharmaceutical startups and their venture capital (VC) investors. We find that common ownership leads VCs to hold back projects, withhold funding, and redirect innovation at lagging startups. Effects are stronger where R&D costs are larger, consistent with common owners aiming to cut duplicate costs. Effects are also stronger where technological similarity is greater and preexisting competition is lower, consistent with common owners seeking market power for their surviving projects. Overall, common VC ownership appears to generate social benefits, via improved innovation efficiency, but also social costs.

    abstract: This study examines the link between credit supply and hospital health outcomes. We use bank stress tests as exogenous shocks to credit access for hospitals that have lending relationships with tested banks. We find that affected hospitals shift their operations to increase resource utilization following a negative credit shock but reduce the quality of their care to patients across a variety of measures, including a significant increase in risk-adjusted readmission and mortality rates. The results indicate that access to credit can affect the quality of healthcare hospitals deliver, pointing to important spillover effects of credit market frictions on health outcomes.

    abstract: We study financial effects of remote product delivery in the healthcare industry. Exploiting staggered law adoption for identification, we find that telehealth provision redistributes hospital operations and access to capital away from rural communities. As urban telehealth providers acquire rural patients, rural hospitals experience decreased revenue and profit, credit rating downgrades, increased cost of capital, and ultimately risk of closure. Although telehealth reduces travel costs, some communities lose access to acute care. Overall, we conclude that remote healthcare services have financial consequences as well as real effects, and their benefits are unequally distributed.

    abstract: We study the impacts of telehealth adoption on geographic competition among urban and rural healthcare providers. We consider a quasinatural experiment&#58; states’ entry into the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, wherein the entry events facilitate healthcare providers to adopt telehealth technology. By analyzing a representative sample of providers, we first establish the Compact entry shock’s validity and its positive effect on the supply of medical services. We then report evidence that there are service and payment shifts from rural providers to urban providers (i.e., urban providers are more likely to benefit from the Compact entry financially). Relying on patients’ telehealth reimbursement claim data, we observe two mechanisms contributing to the revenue redistribution&#58; the substitution and gateway effects of telehealth. Finally, we show that telehealth readiness and service quality moderate the impact of telehealth adoption. These findings speak to both potentially positive and negative consequences for welfare.

    abstract: We study pivots as signaling devices in a dynamic experimentation model. An entrepreneur receives funding from an investor and has private information about a project, which requires costly experimentation to succeed. The entrepreneur has a real option to pivot, i.e., to abandon the project and to start a new one. Investors learn about the project from the arrival of exogenous information and from the entrepreneur’s pivoting decisions. We characterize signaling equilibria in which high-skill entrepreneurs pivot early. Such early pivots are associated with a higher likelihood of success and with more favorable funding terms following the pivot.

    abstract: This paper explores the relationship between a firm’s legal contracting environment and its innovation incentives. Using granular data from the pharmaceutical industry, we examine a contracting mechanism through which incumbents maintain market power&#58; “pay-for-delay” agreements to delay the market entry of competitors. Exploiting a shock where such contracts become legally tenuous, we find that affected incumbents subsequently increase their innovation activity across a variety of project-level measures. Exploring the nature of this innovation, we also find that it is more “impactful” from a scientific and commercial standpoint. The results provide novel evidence that restricting the contracting space can boost innovation at the firm level. However, at the extensive margin we find a reduction in innovation by new entrants in response to increased competition, suggesting a nuanced effect on aggregate innovation.

    abstract: We study dynamic Bayesian persuasion in an entry game. A sender publicly reveals information to an adopter and a competitor who decide when to irreversibly enter or exit a market. When the sender's loss from competition is small, the sender first provides information to attract the adopter, and then aims to reveal sufficiently negative information to deter the competitor. Otherwise, the optimal policy is reversed. The sender first aims to provide negative information to deter the competitor and then to reveal positive information to attract the adopter. We interpret the optimal policy as inducing hype cycles, and show that hype cycles are more severe in stagnant industries or with higher threat of competition.

    abstract: We assess how labor mobility affects intangible investment in a dynamic agency model featuring both knowledge appropriation and moral hazard. We argue that restricting worker mobility, while reducing employees' appropriation of firm intangible capital, can hurt their incentives to exert effort. Our calibration to U.S. data targets responses of employee turnover and firms' intangible investment to variations in workers' outside option values, identified through exogenous shocks to non-compete enforcement. The model simulation implies that knowledge spillovers mitigate the costs of incentive provision when agency frictions are severe, and the optimal labor mobility regulation should balance this benefit against turnover risk. Finally, we highlight the use of deferred compensation bonuses in the optimal contract as a retention mechanism, even among under-performing firms.

    abstract: We utilize granular data from the life sciences sector to study how VC activism influences strategic experimentation decisions. Active involvement by smaller, more focused VCs drives early pipeline prioritization, advancing a few projects while holding back most of the R&D portfolio. While this approach can create "blockbuster" IPOs with mature lead pipelines, it also reduces overall exit likelihood by sacrificing the benefits of a diversified pipeline. Startups backed by concentrated VCs progress more slowly in clinical trials on average and are more likely to discontinue projects due to prioritization rather than financial or quality concerns. Additionally, VCs may prioritize suboptimal projects due to investment horizons or concerns about portfolio cannibalization. Overall, this prioritization strategy increases failure risk particularly for high-risk, long-horizon technologies. To address endogeneity, we exploit limited partners’ adoption of ESG objectives as instruments for shifts in VCs’ portfolio focus.

    abstract: We document that interactions with manipulated decision support systems can distort the development of human capital using the context of opioid prescription. Physicians in our sample adopted electronic health record software from a list of federally certified companies in 2011. Between 2016 and spring 2019, one company secretly embedded a biased decision support system function to promote extended-release opioid sales. Affected physicians not only increased opioid claims relative to the control group during the treatment window but also maintained a higher propensity for prescriptions even after the removal of the biased function. This long-term distortion of human capital relies on the unconsciousness of algorithmic biases and does not occur following other explicit promotions, such as pharmaceutical detailing payments. Using machine-learning algorithms, we quantify that human capital distortion explains 54% of the treatment effects in a physician decision model with dynamic learning. Experience with opioids, along with caution regarding elder patients, mitigates the distortion.

    abstract: We examine how public health crises undermine bank deposit funding and constrain lending activities. Using the opioid epidemic as our empirical setting, we document a negative link between local opioid supply and deposit growth at both the county and bank levels. Facing deposit drains, banks systematically reduce lending activities, including mortgage origination and approval, even in distant regions connected to the epidemic areas through banking networks. These reductions are more pronounced for retained loans and concentrate in smaller banks facing greater financial frictions and lacking geographic diversification. Our findings highlight the challenges to bank operations arising from population health conditions.
