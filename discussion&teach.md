<span style="color:#64a1bd"><strong>FINCB 8356&#58; Financing Innovation in Healthcare&nbsp;</strong></span> I designed this course for the <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/healthcare/about/faculty" target="_blank">Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Management Program</a> at Columbia Business School to offer a structured perspective on how innovation in the healthcare sector is financed. The first half focuses on the biopharma industry, addressing unique valuation challenges and the risk-return dynamics that shape investment decisions. We then examine the critical roles of government funding, non-profits, venture capital, and M&A activity in advancing innovation. In the second half, the course turns to U.S. hospitals, analyzing how financial structures and external capital impact care quality and technology adoption. This course is intended for graduate-level students interested in the intersection of finance, innovation, and health policy.
