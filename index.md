## Welcome

My research sits at the intersection of finance and healthcare, exploring how fundamental corporate finance decisions, specifically financing and investment, shape the economic landscape of the medical industry. By leveraging novel, granular datasets on healthcare operations and innovation, I apply both empirical and theoretical frameworks to analyze the U.S. hospital sector and the dynamics of pharmaceutical investment. I also serve as a faculty member of the <a href="https://business.columbia.edu/healthcare/about/faculty" target="_blank">Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Management Program</a> at Columbia Business School.

I earned my PhD in Finance from the University of Minnesota (2014-2020) and my Bachelor of Science in Finance from Peking University (2010-2014).
