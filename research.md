    abstract: How do innovative firms react when existing products experience negative shocks? We explore this question with detailed project-level data from drug development firms. Using FDA Public Health Advisories as idiosyncratic negative shocks to approved drugs, we examine how drug makers react through investment decisions. Following these shocks, affected firms increase R&D expenditures, driven by a higher likelihood of acquiring external innovations, rather than developing novel projects internally. Such acquisition activities are concentrated in firms with weak research pipelines. We also find that competing developers move resources away from the affected therapeutic areas. Our results show how investments in specialized commercialization capital create path dependencies and alter the direction of R&D investments.

    abstract: How does common ownership affect innovation? We study this question using project-level data on pharmaceutical startups and their venture capital (VC) investors. We find that common VC ownership reduces duplication of R&D in patent races. Specifically, common ownership leads VCs to shut down lagging drug projects, withhold funding from lagging startups, and redirect those startups' innovation. These results support theories dating back to Loury (1979)&#58; By coordinating R&D efforts across firms in a patent race, a common owner can reduce excess R&D. Consistent with common ownership improving innovation efficiency, common ownership rates are positively correlated with the ratio of R&D output to funding.

    abstract: This study examines the link between credit supply and hospital health outcomes. Using detailed data on hospitals and the banks that they borrow from, we use bank stress tests as exogenous shocks to credit access for hospitals that have lending relationships with tested banks. We find that affected hospitals shift their operations to increase patient revenues in response to a negative credit shock, but reduce the quality of their care to patients across a variety of measures. In particular, affected hospitals exhibit significantly lower attentiveness in providing timely and effective treatment and procedures and are rated substantially lower in patient satisfaction. This decline in care quality is reflected in health outcomes&#58; affected hospitals experience a significant increase in risk-adjusted, unplanned 30-day readmission rates of recently discharged patients and in risk-adjusted 30-day patient mortality rates. Overall, the results indicate that access to credit can affect the quality of healthcare hospitals deliver, pointing to important spillover effects of credit market frictions on health outcomes.

    abstract: Using the staggered implementation of telehealth parity laws in the U.S. Healthcare industry, we find causal evidence that virtual competition affects U.S. hospitals' cost of capital through a credit risk channel. Financial statements indicate that rural hospitals lose patients to urban hospitals in the same state after states require equivalent reimbursement of remote and in-person services. These effects increase rural hospital bankruptcy risk indicated by leverage and Z-Score. This increased financial stress translates into lower credit ratings and a higher cost of capital for rural hospitals. Controlling for bond characteristics, we find that affected rural hospitals' new bond costs rise by 21 - 49 bps relative to urban hospital bonds issued in the same state and in the same year. Secondary market yields of outstanding rural bonds increase by a significant 8 - 15 bps. Overall, this paper implies that virtual competition creates financial distress for rural healthcare providers.

    abstract: How does a firm’s market power in existing products affect its incentives to innovate? We explore this fundamental question using granular project-level and firm-level data from the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on a particular mechanism through which incumbent firms maintain their market power&#58; “reverse payment” or “pay-for-delay” agreements to delay the market entry of competitors. We first show that when firms are unfettered in their use of “pay-for-delay” agreements, they reduce their innovation activities in response to the potential entry of direct competitors. We then examine a legal ruling that subjected these agreements to antitrust litigation, thereby reducing the incentive to enter them. After the ruling, incumbent firms increased their net innovation activities in response to competitive entry. These effects center on firms with products that are more directly affected by competition. However, at the product therapeutic area level, we find a reduction in innovation by new entrants after the ruling in response to increased competition. Overall, these results are consistent with firms having reduced incentives to innovate when they are able to maintain their market power, highlighting a specific channel through which this occurs.

    abstract: We study venture capital financing with experimentation. An entrepreneur contracts with an investor and has private information about a project, which requires costly experimentation by both parties to succeed. In equilibrium, investors learn about the project from the arrival of exogenous information and from the entrepreneur's contract offers. The optimal contract features vesting and dilution, consistent with empirical evidence. Pivots and prestige projects emerge as signaling devices. Technological progress, which lowers the cost of experimentation or which increases the rate of learning, makes entrepreneurs pivot more aggressively in equilibrium.

    abstract: We study dynamic Bayesian persuasion in an entry game. A sender publicly reveals information to an adopter and a competitor. When the sender's loss from competition is small, the optimal policy features hype cycles&#58; the sender first exaggerates the value of a technology to attract the adopter, and then reveals negative information to deter the competitor. Otherwise, the optimal policy features caution&#58; the sender first underplays the value of the technology and reveals positive information later. Hype cycles are more severe in stagnant industries and with higher threat of competition, and arise in industries where the adopter's and the competitor's entry decisions are complementary.

    abstract: We study the impacts of telehealth adoption on geographic competition among urban and rural healthcare providers, and associated quality of care implications. To causally identify these effects, we consider a quasi-natural experiment&#58; states' entry into the Telemedicine Licensure Compact, wherein participating states coordinate to streamline licensing for physicians wishing to provide telehealth services across state lines. We first show that affected physicians receive more state licenses and earn higher Medicare payments, thereby establishing the Compact entry shock's validity and its positive effect on telehealth adoption. We then examine the heterogeneous effects on provider earnings and quality of care across urban and rural areas. We report evidence that urban providers are systematically more likely to respond to the policy change and financially benefit from it by expanding their service scope to a wider geographic market. As urban providers begin to offer their services to rural patients, rural physicians and hospitals experience a decline in patient volumes, and a revenue loss in turn. We subsequently consider parallel impacts on patient quality of care, and we discuss the implications of our results for healthcare providers and government.
